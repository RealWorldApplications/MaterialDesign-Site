# Icon Naming

MDI has strong guidelines setup to ensure naming of every icon is as _consistent_ and expandable as possible.

## Base Names

Base names are generally the noun representation of an icon. In some cases this may also be the more common software term for the icon.

Examples: `comment`, `folder`, or `flask`

## Hyphen Tagging

All naming must be in the exact order below.

| Position          | Weight    | Overlay      | Modifier     |
|-------------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| `*-top-left`      | `*-bold`  | `*-alert`    | `*-multiple` |
| `*-top-right`     | `*-thick` | `*-arrow-*`  | `*-variant`  |
| `*-bottom-left`   |           | `*-network`  | `*-off`      |
| `*-bottom-right`  |           | `*-settings` | `*-outline`  |
| `*-up`            |           | `*-plus`     |              |
| `*-down`          |           | `*-minus`    |              |
| `*-left`          |           | `*-remove`   |              |
| `*-right`         |           | `*-search`   |              |
|                   |           | `*-question` |              |

### Position

All position modifiers should be used to describe the direction an icon is pointing.

### Overlay

tabs:
tab:naming-alert icon:alert-box

tab:naming-settings icon:settings-helper
tab:naming-plus icon:plus-box
tab:naming-minus icon:minus-box
tab:naming-remove icon:close-box

The arrow modifer can point in any direction and should be placed in the bottom right.

![arrow-right](/assets/resources/grid-96-arrow-right-bottom-right.svg)

The network modifer should only be used to dipict a network connected device or object.

![network](/assets/resources/grid-96-network.svg)

#### Off

## Additional Details

- `outline` must only be used on `2dp` lined icons.
- `variant` is only to be used to represent the same icon with the same meaning.
- `close` is never to be used to represent a `x` on an icon other than the `close-*`. Use `*-remove` for these instances.
- `settings` modifier is represented in Material Design as three dots (`...`) not a `cog` or `gear`.
- `plus` is always used to represent adding (do not use `add`).
- `minus` is always used to represent subtracting.
- `multiple` should be used on layered icons where there is a singular representation present.
- `format-*` breaks all the rules. Because.
- `help` is a base icon, `*-question` is a modifer.
